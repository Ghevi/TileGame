# Bombshell

A little rpg game in Java without levels or gameplay yet, just to test the foundations of a tiles based game. I'm planning to add bugs report system to be visualized on a Rest web service made with Spring.
Note: To run the project in a IDE you have to open the package dev.Ghevi.rpg in the src foulder and then run Launcher.java (main class).

If you just want the game with runnable jar, simply download the "Runnable only" folder.

JAVA 8 update 231 JDK 1.8 JRE 12.0.2

Commands:

WASD : moving the character

arrowKeys : attack in the key direction

E: open/close the inventory
